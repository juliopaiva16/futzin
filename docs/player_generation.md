# Player Generation
Factory assigns tier (1..4) with correlated attribute boosts, height (cm), preferred foot, limited ability set.

Goals:
- Provide variance & strategic drafting.
- Keep ability count constrained initially (8 core) for balance.

Metrics (track in progress/player_generation.yaml): tiers_impl, abilities_impl.

Next: add hooks for advanced abilities & tier distribution balancing.
